### Self-made programmer

Hi there, I'm Ra≈üit.
I started to learn programming in June 2022. My goal was to be an Android Dev so I started with [**`Kotlin`**](https://hyperskill.org/profile/273853626) and **Harvard University**'s [CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2022/)(**`Introduction to Computer Science`**).

After a few months, I applied and got accepted to the "[Oyun ve Uygulama Akademisi](https://oyunveuygulamaakademisi.com/)"(Game and Application Academia) program and so I started to learn **`Dart`** and **`Flutter`**. Since then, I keep practicing and making some apps here and there until [graduation](https://verified.sertifier.com/en/verify/61656387413922/). This effort got me a **_full-time job_** as a **Flutter Developer** in August 2023. 

As part of my job, I made 1 Windows app and 2 mobile apps(iOS & Android) for the company I worked at as the single Flutter Developer there. I made those apps **_all by myself_** end-to-end.
They  had:
```
 - Firebase Authentication
 - Firebase storage
 - Bluetooth Classic communication
 - Bluetooth Low Energy communication
 - State management(Bloc & Provider)
 - Hand-written C++ native code for Windows
 - Live sensor plot graphs
```
